# CRBON LABS TAKE HOME EXERCISE
By: Chase Churla

I chose a python3 implementation. I avoided using
anything not included in the standard library so no
packages are necessary as long as python3 is installed.

To run it interactively, with the cli front end, simply use:

```$ python3 main.py```

To run the test suite use:

```$ python3 -m unittest testing.py```
